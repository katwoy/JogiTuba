# JogiTuba

My final project of the course "JavaScript Developer: React" led by Coders Lab - IT School.

JogiTuba is an app using the YouTube API. User can choose a teacher with whom he wants to pracitce yoga or meditation. Then the list of available videos is shown and user can choose the one he wants to watch.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To start the app in the development mode - in the project directory, you can run:<br />
### `yarn start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
