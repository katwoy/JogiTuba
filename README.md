# JogiTuba

JogiTuba is my final project of the course "JavaScript Developer: React" led by Coders Lab - IT School.

JogiTuba is a React app using the YouTube API. It's a place with a wide selection of videos with yoga and meditation. User can choose a teacher with whom he wants to pracitce yoga or meditation. Then the list of available videos is shown and user can choose the one he wants to watch.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the app in the development mode - use `yarn start` in the project directory.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
